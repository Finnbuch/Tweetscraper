# Tweetscraper

This repository was created to scrape Tweets quicker then the offical free API limits allow using browser automatization
Further the script Twitter_Plotter.py can be used to create simple Wordclouds from the scraped Tweets.

Currently the scraping script is outdated due to recent changes of the platform X (Twitter)
